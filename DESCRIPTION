Description: ChromENVEE is a package developed to study chromatin states.
  This package implements functions to associate all the neighbouring genes to a list of enhancers
  and to define the chromatin environment of genes using chromatin states informations
  (e.g., ChromHMM output). Several visualization functions are available to summarize the
  distribution of chromatin states, characterize genes associated with enhancers and also assign
  chromatin environment to genes.
