Description: This package implements functions to associate genes with enhancers, define the
chromatin environment of the gene from genomic data (e.g. ChromHMM output). Several visualization
functions are available to summarize the distribution of chromatin states, the amount, distance and
expression of genes to enhancers and the dispersion of chromatin states in gene sets.
