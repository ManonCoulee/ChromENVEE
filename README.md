# ChromENVEE (Chromatin ENVironment and Enhancer Expression)

This package implements functions to associated genes with enhancers, defined the chromatin environment of the gene from genomic data (e.g. ChromHMM output). Several visualization functions are available to summarized the distribution of chromatin states, the amount, distance and expression of genes to enhancers and the dispersion of chromatin states in gene sets.
